            The IEEE Robotics and Automation Student Chapter of PES University, in association with cRAIS (Centre for Robotics Automation and Intelligent Systems), has established ReRo Lab, India's first 24/7 remote robotics lab by an educational institution.
          </p>
          <p>
            It offers students and researchers remote access to real robots, allowing users to upload code and perform tests in a safe, controlled environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab is equipped with the latest hardware and software required for remote programming, and a web platform that provides clear visual representation of the robot's movements and actions during the programming process.
          </p>
          <p id="inauguration">
            The lab was inaugurated on 27th March 2023.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab enables users from anywhere in the world to control the robots and run developed algorithms remotely, without needing to purchase any hardware.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab offers a chance to experiment with various features and applications on real robots in a simulated environment with obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab can be used for task testing and training in academia and research.
          </p>
          <p>
            The lab will be autonomous and available for use globally in the near future.
